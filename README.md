# CXplorer

CXplorer is an reconnaissance tool written in Go which is capable of scanning directories, sub domains, open ports and sniff network traffic. For scanning it uses inbuilt net library and for network sniffing it uses gopacket. It is meant to find potential vulnerabilities and loopholes to help the user in improving web and network security.

## Installation

	
    git clone https://github.com/SecurityKnights/CXplorer
    cd CXplorer
    ./INSTALL.sh
    
Note: If you get any error related to 'Unable to Create Directories', do the same manually and then run the './INSTALL.sh' command again. This can happen due to lack of permissions.
